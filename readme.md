# Adam Martin, Flight Analysis Engineer I/II Test
- This was originally submitted on 3/17/2025, but due to RL IT denying zip files in email attachments I decided to make a git repo.
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required libraries.
- Running main.py will produce all of the plots. I performed part 1 and 2 of the tests with both the 3-dof and 5-dof methods.
